# Little-Mermaid-Twine-Project-
An adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's Little Mermaid, built in Twine. 

I made this as my final assignment for my college game writing class. It's a simple text-based choose-your-own adventure game built in Twine, an open source engine for web-based text games. 

Play on itch.io: https://okayemjay.itch.io/the-little-mermaid-twine-project

If you want to mess around with my code, please download the HTML file and Twine. You can then import the HTML file into Twine and see all the little secrets hidden from your innocent eyes. 

I would like to update this game with music and change some of the visual elements slightly. Please stay tuned for this! 

Thanks for checking out my game!
